EVE's modeling is complete. To navigate to the Maya file:
graphics/EVE/scenes/eve/eve_with_texture.ma

The EVE model uses textures. Please make sure shaded display with texture maps is on (press 6 on the keyboard).

EVE is modeled using mental ray shaders. If for some reason EVE is not white, enable mental ray plugin by going to Window->Settings/Preferences->Plug-in Manager. Scroll to the bottom and make sure the Mayatomr.mll plugin is Loaded (check the checkbox next to Loaded). To automatically load every time you open Maya, also check Auto load.
